**What is message Encryption?**
- An SMS works on an un-encrypted level. So, anything that is typed can be read by the carrier, government or hacker trying to intercept such messages. On the other hand, chatting apps started deploying encryption in the name of security. What these ensure is that messages canâ€™t be read as there are various levels of encryption deployed and there are, in some cases, only private keys that can be used to access a message. Modern encryptions use algorithms to convert message text into random characters and symbols. This can be decoded only using a key.
